# Sales Opportunities Data Analysis Project - README
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sales data using SQL queries to gain insights into revenue trends, lead sources, top salespeople, and revenue by fiscal years and quarters. The idea was to start by exploring the data, extract insights, and then visualize those insights using visualization using tools like Tableau or Power BI.

## Analysis and Queries
This project contains a series of SQL queries designed to answer specific questions related to sales opportunities data. Some example queries include:

    1. Top 20 clients by total revenue from closed deals
    2. Revenue by Fiscal Year for closed deals
    3. Revenue by Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year for closed deals
Refer to the sales_data.sql file for the full list of queries based on the provided code.
